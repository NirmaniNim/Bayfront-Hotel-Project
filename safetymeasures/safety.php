		<h1>COVID – 19 Safety Measures</h1>
	
			<p>The wellbeing of our guests, staff and associates is important to us. We have introduced a set of safety measures at our hotel to safeguard our valuable guests and staff. Stay safe measures have been compiled to ensure adherence to the guidelines set out by The World Health Organization (WHO) as well as Local Health bureau, Tourism authorities and industry associations. We have put together a list of guidelines that cover all guest areas as well as our back of house operation, food preparation, housekeeping, and our supply chain.</p>

			<p>We are taking proper steps to sanitize all our staff and guest contact areas such as rooms, restaurants, kitchens, public space, associate facilities etc.</p>

			<p>The Management is closely monitoring the global pandemic situation and will actively take steps to mitigate the impact and spread of COVID-19. We would review and update these guidelines regularly to ensure your safety during your stay. You can refer to our FAQs for a quick reference. We value the trust and loyalty you have placed with us and we assure you, your comfort will not be compromised during your stay.</p>
			
			<p>Looking forward to welcoming you back at our properties.</p>

			<p>Our commitment to cleanliness:</p>

			<p>As always, the safety and security of our guests and team members remains our highest priority. We take great pride in maintaining the highest standards of cleanliness and hygiene. In response to the coronavirus, we have taken additional measures developed in consultation with global and local public health authorities to make our cleaning and hygiene protocols even more rigorous:</p>

			<ol>•Our hotel team is  receiving ongoing briefings and enhanced operating protocols.</ol>
			<ol>•We have increased the frequency of cleaning our public areas (including lobbies, door handles, public bathrooms, gym, pool etc.) and have continued the use of safe disinfectants.</ol>
			<ol>•We will continue to adjust food and beverage service in accordance with current food safety recommendations.</ol>
			<ol>•All supplies and materials are sanitized before being admitted into the hotel premises.</ol>
			<ol>•We have increased the deployment of antibacterial hand sanitizers.</ol>
			<ol>•We are making sure your dining experience will be thoughtfully curated keeping in mind limited gathering in restaurant areas and other restrictions for safety.</ol>
			<ol>•Temperature readings of resident and non-resident guests and our associates are taken at the entrance of the hotel.</ol>
			<ol>•If any of the parameters for our guests or colleagues are not normal, a medical examination and medical assistance are provided immediately.</ol>
			<ol>•Masks and disposable gloves are being worn by team members throughout and changed frequently.</ol>

			<p>At BAYFRONT, we believe it is in challenging times like these that the power of hospitality is needed most of all. Whether you are traveling now or in the future, our team members are ready to welcome you with the hospitality you have come to expect.</p>
